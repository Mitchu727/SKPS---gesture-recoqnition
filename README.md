The first time you want to run it, download the version from the __master branch__ and install needed packages using command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
then use the command and go to the indicated address
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Then go to your browser and type in __localhost:8000__.  
That's all. Have a nice use!
